## Purpose of the project
This project is based the previous 2 projects to generate continuous integration using GitHub Actions for Python Data Science Projects with real world data.
The raw data I used is from FiveThirtyEight contains detailed information on murder statistics in U.S. cities and states for the years 2014 and 2015. 

## Data visualization
raw data: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/murder_2016/murder_2015_final.csv
Description for the data:
